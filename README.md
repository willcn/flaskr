# flaskr 2.0

flaskr 2.0 is a copy of the Flask Tutorial, but configured to use Redis
instead of SQLite. This is so people can focus on learning Flask and not
also having to learn about databases.

Redis-Collections makes putting data from Python into a relatively permanent
datastore.

pip install redis-collections
pip install Flask
